## Space Filling Curves
<div class="col2">
<p><img src="./images/Hilbert_curve.svg" alt="Hilcurve" style="width: 275px;"/></p>
<p><img src="./images/peano_curve.png" alt="peano" style="width: 275px;"/></p>
  
  
  
- Limit of a function that passes through every point in space.  
- Peano, Hilbert, Z-curves, others.  
- All have slightly different properties and generating algorithms, but the same basic principles apply.   
</div>

## Neat picture, who cares?
<div class="col2">
<p><img src="./images/rgb-hilbert.png" alt="rgb-hil" style="width: 250px;"/></p>
<p><img src="./images/rgb-seq.png" alt="rgb-seq" style="width: 250px;"/></p>



- Preserves locality of points from one dimension into two.  
- Points that are close in one dimension are close in two.  
- Can display very dense information in a compact form.  
</div>

## Recursion
<div class="col2">

</div>

* Requires two main components:
    + Terminating condition
    + Code to execute
* Think about deleting a folder with several sub-folders:
    + What is the terminating condition?
    + What is the code being executed?
